# AASFix

A tool to fix namespace issues in AASX files.

This tool becomes obsolete when [Bug #666](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aasx-package-explorer/issues/666) is fixed and AASX Package Explorer produces standard compliant files.

## Description

This tool can fix the namespace problems of certain versions of AASX Package Explorer (e.g. v2023-11-17), documented in [Bug #666](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aasx-package-explorer/issues/666).

After applying the fix (`--fix`), the AASX file should be standard compliant and work with libraries such as the [Basyx Python SDK](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-python-sdk).  After un-applying the fix (`--unfix`), the AASX file should be compatible with AASX Package Explorer again. 

Usage: `AASFix <input_file> <output_file> --fix|--unfix`


## Further description of the namespace issue

The [AASX specification](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01005-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part5_AASXPackageFileFormat.pdf) states on page 17 that the namespace for relations is the following: http://admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships.


In consequence, the relationship type in `.rels` files has to be http://admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships. 
For example, the relationship type in `_rels/.rels` has to be http://admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships/aasx-origin. 
However, both the AASX Package Explorer and AAS4J use http://www.admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships as a namespace (note the extra "www").

As a result, the AASX files created by the AASX Package Explorer and AAS4J do not conform to the AASX spec on a structural level. 
On the other hand, the basyx-python-sdk conforms to the AASX spec and uses the correct namespace.

This issue leads to the problem that AASX files generated by the AASX Package Explorer can't be opened with the basyx-python-sdk.

Additionally, AASX files created by the basyx-python-sdk can't be opened with the AASX Package Explorer.
